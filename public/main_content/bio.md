During my bachelor’s degree in Business Administration in South Korea, I discovered a passion for finance and economics. Their complex networks of knowledge reveal insights about human agents and their actions, prompting me to take all available courses in both fields at my universities.

### Study Abroad in Finland
I decided to spend a year studying abroad in Finland, despite not knowing anyone there, to understand why they are the happiest people in the world for six consecutive years. This decision was driven by my desire to overcome personal challenges such as social anxiety, lack of intercultural communication skills, hesitation to take leadership, and fear of stepping out of my comfort zone. 

After 8 months, I was leading 40-45 students on a trip to Lapland, Finland, as part of my Event Manager volunteering position at ESN Helga. I also organized football sessions, hikes, and other nature-related activities weekly for friends and others interested. This experience transformed my character, leading me to plan and execute a 30-day itinerary visiting 12 countries and 21 cities using all means of transportation.

### Further Studies
Upon completing my study abroad program, I applied to finish my bachelor’s degree at Fachhochschule Aachen, Germany, to challenge myself in a new environment. Initially, I did not plan to pursue a master’s degree, but the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI made me realize the growing importance of reasoning in our era of heavy reliance on large language models. Rising interest rates also impacted hiring in many companies. To strengthen my reasoning and argumentation skills, I applied for the MA Philosophy and Economics degree at the University of Bayreuth.

### Experience
My first professional experience was a teaching position at an English Academy, where I gained valuable communication skills and insights into human psychology. Later, I led a team of students in a successful Go-To-Market strategy for the French and Spanish markets for a startup, enhancing my market research skills, competitive analysis, and strategic suggestions on sales leads. As an Analyst at a logistics company, I developed skills in strategic planning, operational management, and time management. I actively follow global financial and economic developments and am a member of Aachen Investment Club’s stock pitch team, analyzing companies and business models.

### Passion for Technology and Startups
My interest in startups and technology has led me to learn and practice data analysis and web development for the past four years. I am proficient in Python, data analysis with pandas or SQL as well as acquired React.js and node.js skills for web development, and have a certificate in advanced computer science topics. This knowledge equips me to analyze, understand, and consult on businesses and their products.

### Notable Projects and Achievements
- **Go-to-Market Strategy for Tikean**: Led a successful project for a data management platform expanding into French and Spanish markets during my exchange year in Finland. Overcame challenges in understanding the product, distributing tasks, and identifying sales leads. The strategy was chosen as the best among all teams.
- **Entrepreneurial Mindset**: At 13, I started a sports news page on Telegram, overcoming challenges in content creation, engagement, and branding. Developed automation bots to streamline content posting and management, organically growing the page to 2800 subscribers before selling it.

### Conclusion
My journey in business administration, finance, and economics, combined with my experiences abroad and professional roles, has shaped my character and skills. I am passionate about continuous learning, technology, startups, and understanding the intricate structures that govern various aspects of life.
