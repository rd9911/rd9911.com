As Steve Jobs famously said: “Creativity is connecting the dots”. There is no doubt that the idea of people coming together has tremendous amounts of benefits for an organization in ways that it contributes to the democracy inside of the company, improvement of ideas by challenging them, and overall, as a rule of thumb, two minds far better than one. Surprisingly, every good idea that is being implemented in a mainstream culture starts to be misused and/or misinterpreted. Religions contributed the equality and morality of human beings towards the nature and other species until religious leaders started to put benefits of themselves above anything else, democracy contributed the equality between government and nation until populists started to use it in their own gains, communism, at first, aimed to get the basic rights of working class people stronger in order to prevent violations of laws by employers until leaders started to misuse it and ignore the issues with it again for their own benefits, and of course, capitalism that made our economy efficient by bringing price signals and profit maximization throughout times became a cult that pursues profits and efficiency over nature and harmony.</p><p>Because we will use the word “collaboration” more than few times, it is wise to ask the question: what is collaboration?
